# nutrition-fitness
In this project I am going to talk about weightlifting and nutritional goals. I am going to talk about how to set attainable goals for weightlifting and make sure you are getting adequate nutrition.
I became interested in fitness in weightlifting in my freshman year of college. I had always lifted before, but never enough to see a difference, I just lifted in the morning foir XC and Swimming. I always wanted to learn more about how to properly fuel my body and build lean muscle, so that is where my love for weightlifting and nutrition started in college.
